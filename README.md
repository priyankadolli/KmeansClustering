# KmeansClustering
Categorizing subcribers into different groups from browser data based 
There are three segments of users based on the given data (I used a k-mean clustering model to answer this question for which I’m sharing the link of the code): 
1)	first segment consists of users who visit recipe section more than any other section such as food, fashion, beauty and news, and they browse recipe section mainly through article type ‘Recipe’ 
2)	Second segment of users visit food section more than any other section and they do not browse content through the most pre-dominant articles types (that is Recipe and List type)
3)	The third segment consists of users who are not avid readers of food and recipe related sections.
From this information, it can suggested that it is necessary to focus more first and second segment of users and their preferred article types in order to capitalize more on the food and recipe content.
